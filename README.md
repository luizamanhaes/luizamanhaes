### ✨ About Me

I started coding while studying Information Systems — and instead of taking the easy route, I co-founded a fintech startup before I even graduated. Since then, I've been building everything from crypto wallets to distributed backend systems that don’t collapse when users show up.

I care about shipping useful stuff, helping teams move faster without losing their minds, and occasionally building things that make people say, “wait, that’s actually kind of cool.” I love building new products and MVPs — fast, functional, and with as little drama as possible.

Outside of work, I’m probably finding new artists to obsess over or catching up on all the TV series I’ve fallen behind on (there are a lot).
